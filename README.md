# Teqit.TeslaInvoices

A console tool to view the summary of a collection of Tesla invoices.

## Instructions

Pass the directory directory to the application through a command-line tool.

Navigate to executable directory:

cd "C:\Users\laure\source\repos\GitHub\Teqit.TeslaInvoices\Teqit.TeslaInvoices\bin\Release\net10.0"
```

Run the tool by passing the directory in which the invoices are located (not the .ZIP file, but an unpacked .ZIP):
